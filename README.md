# Instructions for setup

- Open up two terminals at the base of this repository
- In the first terminal run: `cd backend` then `npm start`
- In the second terminal run : `cd assessment__new-hire--app-dev` then `npm start`
- Correct login credentials
  - name: `test-one`
  - password: `test-one`

# Info

I created a NodeJS Express backend. For authentication, I used the npm package `basic-auth`. I hid my credentials in a .env file and use the npm dotenv package for environmental variables so credentials would be hidden when I pushed in the backend.

# With More time
 - finish checking for overlap
 - fix date error
 - testing using mocha chai
 - more frontend design
 - more in depth understanding of vue
 - cleanup of code
 - put more code into reusable chunks(headers were not working so moved it out of commonRoutes)
